Testing

Test Case 1:
Withing this test case is a simple three line instructions. It involves using an add immediate, then subtracting the two in each register.

Test Case 2:
From the simple example, we go to trying to test a loop with bne. Bne was a difficult instruction to implement initially but the loop shows it is working well for different cases.

Test Case 3:
Load and store word are used here but ihcorecctly to trigger a exit(0) within the actual code. It will work for most of the instructions.

Test Case 4:
Again this reverts to the simple adding example but going through each register. The registers are circled through to make sure each of them work then calls for user input.

The testing done throughout these test cases were just to redo cases from the sample.s, while also covering other cases that weren't involved.
